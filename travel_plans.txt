Once upon a time, there lived a shepherd boy who was bored watching his flock of sheep on the hill. To amuse himself he shouted Wolf Wolf The sheep are being chased by the wolf The villagers came running to help the boy and save the sheep. They found nothing and the boy just laughed looking at their angry faces.
Don't cry wolf when there's no wolf boy they said angrily and left. The boy just laughed at them.
After a while he got bored and cried wolf again fooling the villagers a second time. The angry villagers warned the boy a second time and left. The boy continued watching the flock. After a while, he saw a real wolf and cried loudly Wolf Please help The wolf is chasing the sheep. Help
But this time no one turned up to help. By evening when the boy didn't return home the villagers wondered what happened to him and went up the hill. The boy sat on the hill weeping. Why didn't you come when I called out that there was a wolf he asked angrily. The flock is scattered now he said.
An old villager approached him and said People won't believe liars even when they tell the truth. We'll look for your sheep tomorrow morning. Let's go home now.
Moral
Lying breaks trust. Nobody trusts a liar even when he is telling the truth.
